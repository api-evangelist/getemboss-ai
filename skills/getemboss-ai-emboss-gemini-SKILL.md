name: emboss
description: Fill PDF forms with Emboss. Use when the user has a flat or scanned PDF form and wants it fillable, wants a PDF form filled from notes, a document, or pasted text, wants one form filled for every row of a spreadsheet or CSV, or asks about AcroForm fields, checkboxes, or signature fields in a PDF. Requires the Emboss MCP connector configured in mcp_config.json.

# Emboss

Emboss turns flat PDF forms into fillable AcroForm PDFs and fills them from
values, from documents or notes, or from a spreadsheet, and faxes a finished
PDF to any fax number. Every operation is
billed to the user's Emboss account. The first 5 form creations, 5 context
fills, and 5 standard fills each month are free; free operations are limited
to 5-page forms. `suggest_mapping` is billed as one context fill even when
called on its own, and `fill_batch` runs it automatically (also billed) if
called without an explicit `mapping`.

## Which tool for which task

| User wants | Tool sequence |
|---|---|
| Make a flat PDF fillable | `create_form`, then `get_form` |
| Fill a form from values you already have | `get_form` (to see fields), then `fill_form` |
| Fill a form from a document, notes, or pasted text | `fill_form_from_context`, then poll `get_job` |
| Fill one form per row of a spreadsheet/CSV | `suggest_mapping`, confirm the mapping with the user, then `fill_batch`, then poll `get_batch` |
| Check remaining free operations or billing | `get_usage` |
| Reuse a form already uploaded | `list_forms` first, instead of `create_form` |
| Fax a finished PDF to a number | `send_fax` with `to` in E.164 form and an `artifact_id` from any earlier result (or the `job_id` from `commit_proposal` or `fill_form_from_context` once `get_job` is ready, a `form_id`, or `pdf_url` / `pdf_base64`), then poll `get_fax`. A `sources` list faxes several artifacts as one packet: each entry is an `artifact_id` with an optional `pages` range; pay-per-call callers add an `artifact_token` per entry. |
| Merge, compose, extract, delete, reorder or rotate PDF pages, or inspect a PDF, for free | `merge_pdf`, `compose_pdf`, `extract_pages`, `delete_pages`, `reorder_pages`, `rotate_pages`, or `inspect_pdf`. Each returns an `artifact_id`: pass it into `send_fax`, or into another one of these seven tools to chain further; outputs are deleted after the ephemeral processing window. |

## Rules

- Never invent field values. Only fill what the user gave you, or what a
  context document/CSV actually says.
- When `fill_form` returns `unmatched`, show the user those labels and ask
  what to do with them; do not guess.
- For choice fields, pick one of the options `get_form` returned (its label
  or value) rather than free text.
- For checkboxes, pass `yes` or `no`.
- `fill_form_from_context`, `fill_batch`, and `get_batch` can take a while.
  Poll `get_job` / `get_batch` about every 20 seconds and tell the user it is
  still running rather than going quiet.
- Present every `download_url` as a plain link the user can click.
- On a 402, relay the tool's `message` and point at `billing_url`: for
  `over_free_tier` explain that this month's free forms are used up; for
  `over_page_cap` explain that the form is over the 5-page free limit and a
  payment method is needed to continue.
- On `unsupported_file`, tell the user to export the document to PDF first;
  Emboss only accepts PDFs.
- Never paste long context text back into the chat. Summarize what was sent
  (e.g. "sent the 2-page intake note as context") instead of quoting it in
  full.
- Only call `delete_form` when the user explicitly asks to delete a form.
  It is permanent.
- Before `send_fax`, confirm the destination number with the user and show
  it back in E.164 form (for example +15025551212). Faxes are billed per
  page at delivery; a failed fax is not charged. Poll `get_fax` about every
  20 seconds until `status` is `delivered` or `failed`.

## Getting the PDF in

Prefer, in order:
1. A form already in the user's library: check with `list_forms` before
   creating a new one.
2. A public `https` link to the PDF: pass it as `pdf_url`.
3. `pdf_base64` for small files the user pasted, or that Gemini CLI can read
   from disk. Read the file and base64-encode it yourself. Keep base64
   uploads under 10 MB; for anything larger, ask the user to host it
   somewhere with a public link and use `pdf_url` instead.

The same choice applies to `context_urls` in `fill_form_from_context` and to
`csv_url` in `suggest_mapping` / `fill_batch`: a public https link is
preferred, inline text (`context_text`, `csv_text`) works for small content.

## Signing in

Antigravity CLI does not yet forward OAuth tokens to remote HTTP MCP servers
(antigravity-cli issue #25, open). Until that lands, Emboss authenticates
here with a static API key: add `headers.Authorization` set to
`Bearer <your sk_ key>` in `mcp_config.json` (see this plugin's README for
the exact snippet). If a tool call returns `unauthenticated`, the key is
missing, wrong, or revoked; check the Emboss Dashboard, then Account, then
API keys.

## Examples

**1. "Make this W-9 fillable"** (user attaches a PDF or gives a link)

- Call `create_form` with `pdf_url` (or `pdf_base64` if the file is only
  available locally).
- Call `get_form` with the returned `form_id` to confirm it is `ready` and
  see the fields.
- Say back: "Your W-9 is fillable. Download it here: `<download_url>`. It
  has N fields if you'd like me to fill any of them."

**2. "Fill out this rental application using my notes"**

- If the form is not already in the library, call `create_form` first, then
  `get_form` to see the fields.
- Call `fill_form_from_context` with `form_id` and `context_text` set to the
  user's notes (or `context_urls` if they gave a document link).
- Poll `get_job` with the returned `job_id` every ~20 seconds, telling the
  user it's still processing.
- When `status` is `ready`, say back: "Filled and ready:
  `<download_url>`. I filled N fields; M I couldn't find an answer for."

**3. "Fill this intake form for everyone in my spreadsheet"**

- Call `suggest_mapping` with `form_id` and `csv_url` (or `csv_text`).
- Show the proposed column-to-field mapping and confirm it with the user
  before proceeding (or take their corrected mapping).
- Call `fill_batch` with the confirmed `mapping`.
- Poll `get_batch` with the returned `batch_id` every ~20 seconds until
  `status` is `complete` or `failed`.
- Say back: "Filled N of M rows. Here's the zip: `<zip_url>`" and list any
  per-row errors.
